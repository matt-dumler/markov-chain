# Markov Chain

The Markov Chain algorithm is used to generate random output text from a given
input text. This particular implementation is largely derived from the Kernighan
and Pike implementation detailed in "The Practice of Programming." There is both
a C and a C++ implementation, which intends to show the impact language choice
has on the implementation of a program.

The input text, `divots.txt`, used for testing is the first chapter of a novel
["Divots"](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/72227) which I arbitrarily chose
from the "Golf stories" subject on Project Gutenberg. Below is a sample of the
output generated by the program:
